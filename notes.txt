- operand api
	- should we switch to typescript for the backend resposne so our api access doesn't get cut off, also seems like there are more routes we can use there
	- i haven't gotten any chat response with an answer? is that normal or are my queries bad
	- backend api to let people upload a new book, can we use operand api to index something new? (assuming yes)
- search sidebar: i think we should switch to normal fuzzy search bc that's what people would expect, can leave semantic search to chatbox (also prob doesn't make sense for there to be 2 ways to semantic search anyway)
- user accounts, passwordless vs password? passwordless is annoying but there's less friction for initial signup
- questions within the book
	- should have a checkbox to turn that off*
- flashcards
	- should have a checkbox to hide that sidebar*
- 'user's all books page'
	- zero to one is default for everyone's accounts, but they can delete it
	- add book for $8 or something
	- can see how much spaced repitition is "due" today for that book from this page 
- mobile experience?
- landing page
	- imagining something super simple but elegant
